<h2>I. Description</h2>

Thunder StopWatch is a toy app for Android that can be used to 
estimate the distance to a flash of lightning.

The app:
  * provides a simple timer with large controls
  * automatically estimates the distance sound may have traveled
  * keeps a history of recent times and distances
  * displays a plot of recent distances

Cool Ideas:
  * use the camera to start the timer; analyze frames using a histogram to identify
    the lightning flash.
  * use the microphone to stop the timer; use waveform analysis to identify the thunder.
  * record the direction the device was facing when the timer was started or stopped;
    estimate probable strike zone and display (pass coordinate range to another app for
    display on a map).
